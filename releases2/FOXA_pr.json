Subject to market conditions and other factors, the Company intends to repurchase, in the open market or otherwise, a combination of the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.The Company also announced that it has entered into an accelerated stock repurchase (\"ASR\") transaction to repurchase, in the aggregate, $350 million of the Company's Class A common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. The Company also intends to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock. As a result, the Company expects to complete approximately $500 million of aggregate stock repurchases in the near term.Lachlan K. Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"We are committed to deploying capital to maximize long-term stockholder value through a balanced approach of appropriate organic investment, accretive M&A, and returns of capital to our stockholders. This stock buyback program reflects the confidence we have in the long-term investment case for the Company, which is underpinned by the strength of our core brands and the sustainability of our business, and which we believe is well positioned to continue to generate healthy free cash flow.\"The Board's decision follows the execution of a stockholders agreement by and between the Company and the Murdoch Family Trust (\"MFT\"), which was approved by the independent members of the Board, and which limits the potential accretion of voting power by the MFT and Murdoch family members through market purchases or as an indirect result of repurchases by the Company of shares of Class B common stock. The stockholders agreement provides that the MFT and the Company will not take actions that would result in the MFT and Murdoch family members together owning more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the Class B common stock, or would increase the MFT's voting power by more than 1.75% in any rolling twelve-month period. The MFT would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the MFT and the Murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44% of the outstanding voting power of the Class B Shares, except where a Murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the MFT on any matter. The stockholders agreement will terminate upon the MFT's distribution of all or substantially all of its Class B common stock.
