This product is low in calories, high in all-natural flavors, and does not have a 'hemp' after-taste,\" concluded Mr. Wright [President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company].\"As the second fastest growing branded water among the top 20 brands in the U.S., Alkaline88® provides the Alkaline Water Company with an unrivalled platform to launch its hemp-infused product line, which includes sparkling flavored hemp-infused alkaline water and hemp-infused Alkaline88® original.With the Company's hemp-infused beverages continuing to roll out over the course of the following weeks, the Alkaline Water Company is expected be the first national U.S. beverage company—and the first NASDAQ-listed company—to bring premium, hemp-infused alkaline water to U.S. consumers - attacking one of the biggest potential beverage categories in the coming years: CBD-infused drinks.Alkaline88® is already sold in over 47,500 retail locations nationwide in all 50 states, with a distribution that spans more than 150,000 stores, including 9 of the top 10 largest retailers in the entire U.S., such as Whole Foods, and two of the largest retailers in the world such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Krogers (NYSE:KR).WalmartAs the world's largest company by revenue, Walmart Inc.(NYSE:WMT) serves nearly 270 million customers a week through more than 11,700 stores across 28 countries.In 2018, the company recorded revenue of over $500 billion—and it appears that bottled water may deserve some of the credit.Via Thinknum:\"Of the 15 types of bottled water that Walmart [sells], every single one of them ranks in the top-100 products sold . . .\"While bottled sparkling, antioxidant-infused, and alkaline water products make up a significant portion of Walmart's highest consumer rated water products, Walmart's commitment to a \"Everyday low price\" (EDLP) pricing strategy has helped Sam's Choice—the Company's discounted, private labelled water brand—become its best-selling bottled water product.Thinknum continues:\". . . Sam's Choice — Walmart's in-house brand — takes the top four spots of [Walmart's] most-sold bottled-water products . . .\"The popularity of Sam's Choice comes as little surprise, especially considering Walmart's cost-sensitive retail culture. However, its broad appeal comes at the cost of alienating some of today's stickiest consumers—specifically those that prefer more premium, health conscious products. It's worth noting that the Alkaline Water Company's (NASDAQ: WTER and TSX-V:WTER) are sold in Walmart stores across the country.Amazon & Whole FoodsWith its acquisition of Whole Foods back in 2017, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's largest e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform as measured by revenue and market capitalization, is quickly emerging as one of the world's largest water retailers. Last January, Amazon had announced that net sales for the company had increased 31% to $232.9 billion for the full year 2018.Much like Walmart, Amazon has created its own private label bottled water in hopes of capturing the cost-sensitive consumer.Via Inc.:\". . . Amazon is selling 12 packs of 365 Everyday Value flavored sparkling water at a deep discount for Amazon Prime members . . .\"The deal highlights how Amazon is using Whole Foods . . . to go after some of the hottest brands in consumer-packaged goods . . . Whole Foods introduced 365-branded canned sparkling water in September 2017, a month after Amazon closed the acquisition.\"But while Amazon's \"365 Everyday Value\" branded water products attempts to capture market share in the same way as Walmart's Sam's Choice, it too fails to command a premium price like other national label water products.KrogerThe Kroger Co.(NYSE:KR), the largest grocery chain in the United States, recently announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and 2018 fiscal year. The results were less-than-stellar.For the fourth quarter ended February 2, net earnings fell from $854 million to $259 million, a 70% decrease. Total sales fell 1.2% to $121.2 billion in 2018 compared to $122.7 billion in 2017.Despite missing analyst earnings targets, Kroger Chairman and CEO William R. McMullen believes that the company has successfully laid the groundwork to hit its 2020 Restock Krogertargets.Via Supermarket News:\"The ‘Restock Kroger' initiative will involve an accelerated and more data-driven effort around pricing, personalized communications with customers and a massive revamp of product assortments . . .\"One product assortment undergoing significant change happens to be beverages.Supermarket News continues:\"We've reinvented what beverage sections look like,\" said Stuart Aitkin, CEO of Kroger's 84.51° data analytics division. \"We need to make sure our stores stay relevant.\"Though clearly resource intensive, bold initiatives like ‘Restock Kroger,' are key to staying in touch with today's rapidly changing consumer preferences. It's again worth noting that Kroger's also carries Alkaline88®.CostcoCostco Wholesale Corporation(NASDAQ:COST), the world's largest retailer after Walmart, recently reported its fiscal second quarter results. The results beat analyst expectations; net sales for the quarter increased 7.3%, to $34.63 billion from $32.28 billion last year, while net income for the quarter came in at $889 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $701 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, last year.Much of Costco's growth can be attributed to its Kirkland Signature private label brand—a rare example of a private label done right.Via Business Insider:\" . . . Kirkland accounted for nearly a third of all Costco's [2018] sales. Customers see the brand [Kirkland] as a blend of quality and value, and it gives shoppers a unique reason to go to Costco that other retailers can't match — online or off.\"While Costco's Kirkland Signature brand presents a real challenge to many of today's national labels, its bottled water products sacrifice innovation for affordability—like so many of today's other private bottled water brands. But it certainly seems to work.Private Water Brands Lack 'Premium' Consumer AppealThough major retailers are investing in the growth of private label water brands like never before, it appears that \"in-house\" retailer water brands have still failed to capture the premium consumer.Via Grocery Dive:\"According to the firm's and the Food Marketing Institute's 'Power of Private Brands' report released this summer, dollar share of grocery private label in the premium (24%), value (18%) and organic (6%) segments has remained unchanged since 2015 despite shifting industry economics.\"This is largely due to the fact that private label water brands have historically focused on value over innovation. However, they may not have to create products for the premium market. The Big Box Retailers, such as Walmart and Kroger, have the added benefit of not only selling their own private-label value brands, but selling premium and innovative brands, such as the Alkaline Water Company's Alkaline88®.Furthermore, the CBD/hemp-infused segment is expected to be one of the hottest beverage trends in the coming years, but its launch still comes with jurisdictional risk. The Big Box Retailers can let the smaller, more nimble companies - such as the Alkaline Water Company - figure it out first, and then carry their products later when it becomes more mainstream.The original post can be found here: https://mugglehead.com/bottled-water-trends-in-2019/Disclosure: Directors of Mugglehead own shares of The Alkaline Water Company Inc. and other marijuana stocks not mentioned in this release and we have been compensated by the Alkaline Water Company for news coverage.About MuggleheadMugglehead.com is a digital publisher dedicated to cannabis news, investments, culture, and science, owned by Mugglehead Media Corp.

        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Mar 11, 2019 5:18PM EDT",
        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 11, 2019 / BBX Capital Corporation (NYSE: BBX, OTCQX:BBXTB) (\"BBX Capital\" or the \"Company\") reported today its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018.Selected highlights of BBX Capital's consolidated financial results include:Fourth Quarter 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2017:Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017:(1) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of BBX Capital's cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment.(2) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of BBX Capital's net income to adjusted EBITDA.Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017:\"The Company recently announced its intention to take Bluegreen Vacations Corporation (NYSE:BXG) (\"Bluegreen\") private through a statutory short-form merger under Florida law. Each share of Bluegreen's common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger, other than shares beneficially owned by BBX Capital and shareholders who duly exercise and perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Florida law, would pursuant to the merger be converted into the right to receive $16.00 per share in cash. As a result of the proposed merger, BBX Capital will own 100% of Bluegreen Vacations,\" commented Alan B. Levan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital Corporation.Bluegreen Vacations\"During 2018, Bluegreen Vacations focused on expanding inventory and its footprint, improving efficiencies and revenue capabilities, and positioning the company for future growth. Highlights include: its agreement to acquire inventory and, by 2021, the resort management contract with Manhattan Club in New York City; its acquisition of the Éilan Hotel & Spa in San Antonio, Texas, and its fee-based service agreement with Marquee Resort in New Orleans, Louisiana. During 2018, Bluegreen also adopted a no tolerance policy toward abusive practices by so-called ‘timeshare exit firms' and took a critical first step in Bluegreen's ongoing ERP modernization project with the installation of an upgraded point of sale and sales and inventory accounting system. Bluegreen also continued its focus on improving its marketing efforts including testing new digital programs in tandem with its traditional marketing programs, as well as exploring supplementary marketing alliances and channels. Bluegreen's goal is growth in its portfolio of comprehensive, fee-based resort management, financial and sales and marketing services, and continued improvement in market efficiencies with a focus on increasing average sales volume per guest and average sales price per transaction.BBX Capital Real Estate\"Throughout 2018, BBX Capital Real Estate continued to pursue its growth strategy by focusing on acquiring or developing primarily for-sale housing communities, rental apartment communities and commercial properties, as well as investing in opportunistic real estate joint ventures with third party developers. During the year, BBX Capital Real Estate's joint venture investments both completed projects and commenced new projects. Efforts were also directed toward maximizing value at its mixed-use developments by monetizing outparcels and buildings within its legacy assets and projects. BBX Capital Real Estate also experienced strong lot sales at its Beacon Lake Community in St. Johns County, Florida during the year. With a focus towards future sustainable growth and diversification, BBX Capital Real Estate acquired a fifty percent (50%) membership interest in The Altman Companies, LLC and interests in the management of seven multi-family real estate developments of Altman. We believe this transaction will provide BBX Capital Real Estate a more complete operating platform to support its long-term growth.IT'SUGAR\"IT'SUGAR, one of the largest specialty candy retailers in the world, opened four new stores in 2018. In November 2018, IT'SUGAR announced the return of FAO Schweetz, the over-the-top, 2,150-square-foot candy shop and \"retail-tainment\" experience operated by IT'SUGAR within the FAO Schwarz flagship store in New York City at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.Renin Holdings\"During 2018, Renin continued its retail and online growth through distribution at Lowes, Home Depot, and Wayfair. In December, one of the Company's best-selling barn style door kits became available to Costco members across the country (in store and online). Renin recently showcased its product assortment of closet doors, barn style doors, door hardware, and home décor products at the International Builders Show (\"IBS\") in Las Vegas. IBS is one of the largest gathering of home and building professionals in North America with upwards of 60,000 attendees. Renin's products, particularly its barn-style doors, continue to be featured on \"Property Brothers,\" HGTV's hit television series.\"As we have stated each quarter, since many of our assets do not generate income on a regular or predictable basis, our objective continues to be long term growth as measured by increases in book value and intrinsic value over time. Our goal is to streamline our business verticals so that our business model can be more easily analyzed and followed by the markets. To this end, we will continue to review the performance of our assets and investments and consider transactions involving the sale, disposition or a spin-off of assets, investments or subsidiaries,\" Levan concluded.For additional information regarding the proposed merger, please view BBX Capital's press release issued on March 4, 2019, and more detailed information regarding the merger, including additional details regarding the terms of the merger, how the merger will affect Bluegreen's shareholders, and the rights of Bluegreen's shareholders with respect to the merger, including, without limitation, appraisal rights, will be contained in a Schedule 13E-3 to be filed with the SEC by BBX Capital (and certain other filers). Such Schedule 13E-3 and amendments thereto will be available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the final Schedule 13E-3 will be mailed to Bluegreen's shareholders at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the merger. Bluegreen's shareholders should carefully review the entire Schedule 13E-3.For more complete and detailed information regarding BBX Capital and its financial results, business, operations, investments and risks, please see BBX Capital's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which will be available on the SEC's website, https://www.sec.gov, and on BBX Capital's website, www.BBXCapital.com, upon filing with the SEC.Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The Company refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, System-wide Sales of VOIs, and Free Cash Flow.

In addition, BBX Capital Real Estate continued its development of the Beacon Lake Community in St. Johns County, Florida, and closed on the sale of 46 developed lots to homebuilders, resulting in $4.6 million in revenues and $1.8 million of pre-tax income.During the quarter, BBX Capital Real Estate also expanded its operating platform through the acquisition of a 50% membership interest in the Altman Companies, a developer and manager of multifamily apartment communities.Renin - Selected Financial DataSelected highlights of Renin's financial results include:Fourth Quarter 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2017:Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017:(1) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of Renin's net income to Adjusted EBITDA.Renin's operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 reflect an increase in trade sales associated with a higher volume of sales to retail distributors, partially offset by a decrease in its gross margin percentage primarily due to higher product costs and inventory reserves. In addition, selling, general, and administrative expenses declined as a result of cost saving initiatives at its manufacturing facilities and corporate offices.IT'SUGAR- Selected Financial DataSelected highlights of IT'SUGAR's financial results include:Fourth Quarter 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2017:Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Period from June 16, 2017 (Date of Acquisition) Through December 31, 2017:IT'SUGAR's operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 reflect revenues associated with the previously announced FAO Schweetz location in New York City operated by IT'SUGAR, which opened during the quarter, and increased costs primarily associated with hiring three new executives, including the previously announced appointment of Mark Davis as IT'SUGAR's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.Other Investments:The Company has other investments in various operating businesses, including restaurant locations throughout Florida and companies in the confectionery industry, which generated aggregate losses before income taxes of $5.7 million and $8.7 million, including impairment losses of $4.0 million and $5.4 million, during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's losses before income taxes from these other investments were $16.8 million and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although the Company expects to continue to incur losses from these businesses during 2019, the Company has been engaged in efforts during 2018 to reduce the size of certain of these businesses, including the closure of manufacturing facilities and the elimination of corporate personnel and infrastructure.---About BBX Capital Corporation:BBX Capital Corporation (NYSE:BBX) (OTCQX:BBXTB) is a Florida-based diversified holding company whose principal investments include Bluegreen Vacations Corporation (NYSE:BXG), BBX Capital Real Estate, Renin Holdings, and IT'SUGAR.

third party immediately prior to the sale. Sales of VOIs owned by third parties are transacted as sales of VOIs in Bluegreen's Vacation Club through the same selling and marketing process it uses to sell its VOI inventory. Bluegreen considers system-wide sales of VOIs to be an important operating measure because it reflects all sales of VOIs by its sales and marketing operations without regard to whether Bluegreen or a third party owned such VOI inventory at the time of sale. System-wide sales of VOIs should not be considered as an alternative to sales of VOIs or any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP or to any other method of analyzing results as reported under GAAP.The following supplemental table represents BBX Capital's free cash flow (1) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as a reconciliation

The Company and Bluegreen focus on the generation of free cash flow. The Company considers free cash flow to be a useful supplemental measure of the Company's and Bluegreen's ability to generate cash flow from operations and is a supplemental measure of liquidity. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company's computation of free cash flow may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies. Investors are cautioned that the item excluded from free cash flow is a significant component in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.The following supplemental table

net income, before taking into account interest income (excluding interest earned on VOI notes receivable), interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred on financings related to Bluegreen's receivable-backed notes payable), income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization. For purposes of the EBITDA calculation, no adjustments were made for interest income earned on Bluegreen's VOI notes receivable or the interest expense incurred on debt that is secured by such notes receivable because they are both considered to be part of the operations of Bluegreen's business.Bluegreen's Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations (in which Bluegreen has a 51% equity interest) and items that the Company believes are not representative of ongoing operating results.The Company considers Bluegreen's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of Bluegreen's operating performance, and they are used to measure Bluegreen's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. Additionally, the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the related depreciation and amortization expense among companies.The Company considers Bluegreen's Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure of Bluegreen's operating performance that facilitates the comparability of historical financial periods.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Bluegreen's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company's computation of Bluegreen's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing Bluegreen's financial performance.The following supplemental table

taking into account interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of product displays provided to customers for marketing purposes that are presented as a reduction of trade sales under GAAP.Renin's Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for foreign exchange gains and losses, as exchange rates may vary significantly among companies.The Company considers Renin's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of Renin's operating performance, and they are used to measure Renin's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry.The Company considers Renin's Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure of Renin's operating performance that facilitates the comparability of historical financial periods.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Renin's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company's computation of Renin's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies, and investors are cautioned that items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing Renin's financial performance.The following supplemental table presents BBX Capital's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (1) defined below,

income, before taking into account interest income (excluding interest earned on VOI notes receivable), interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred on financings related to Bluegreen's receivable-backed notes payable), income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization. For purposes of the EBITDA calculation, no adjustments were made for interest income earned on Bluegreen's VOI notes receivable or the interest expense incurred on debt that is secured by such notes receivable because they are both considered to be part of the operations of Bluegreen's business.BBX Capital's Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest in Bluegreen and Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations (in which Bluegreen has a 51% equity interest) and items that the BBX Capital believes are not representative of ongoing operating results including restructuring charges and goodwill impairment losses.The BBX Capital considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of BBX Capital's operating performance, and they are used to measure BBX Capital's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. Additionally, the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the related depreciation and amortization expense among companies.BBX Capital considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance that facilitates the comparability of historical financial periods.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of BBX Capital's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. BBX Capital's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing BBX Capital's financial performance.SOURCE:BBX Capital Corporation"
